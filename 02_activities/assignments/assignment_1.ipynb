The order of the call stack and a list matched the closed brackets with the open ones inside the list so that the open brackets stay in the list until they are closed and 'popped off' the stack. It got a lot easier after I sorted out the edge cases (no odd len of s, no closed bracket in s[0]). The next idea was to make two lists, onen of open and one of closed brackets where they were 'paired' by index.\n",

Open brackets are added to a stack called bracket_stack, closed brackets are compared by index number to the last thing added to bracket_stack and if they match 'pop', they are removed from the list. If by the end of s there is anything left in bracket_stack then you know there is a mismatch so you get FALSE returned. If everything in the list is paired up you get TRUE returned.\n"
